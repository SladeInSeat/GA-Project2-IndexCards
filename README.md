## Technologies used:
  MEHN stack ( MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, Node), Bootstrap, HTML, Javascript, CSS, git, git-hub, Postman, Compass

## Requirements:
  Up to date browser

## Process:
1. Planning stage:
    * White-boarding to establish high-level overview of schemas, models, and processes.
    * Wire-framing to fill out user experience and connectivity.
    * Organizing concepts into measureable steps, and create issues for [Project Board](https://github.com/SladeInSeat/GA-Project2-IndexCards/projects/1)
      * Group issues by connectivity/simliarity of data/structure
1. Production stage:
    * Achieve minimum functionality for related pages and dependent processes, one at a time.  For example, working on the landing page route, view, and controller together allowed Postman testing to verify functionality. View Topics functionality is dependent on having a parent user, so all user functionality achieved first.
    * Reassess intital goals during productionn process and tweak process/goals as needed.
